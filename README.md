# Food-Delivery frontend and backend app

## MERN app

Welcome to my app ðŸ‘‹

## View deployment:

While developing, I was storing both frontend and backend in this repo. 
But for deploy I've splitted Frontend to new repository https://github.com/NemesisUA/food-delivery-app 
And for Backend new repository is https://github.com/NemesisUA/food-delivery-api
You can move to those repoes, or watch deployment by links below:

I've deployed **frontend** on gh-pages:
