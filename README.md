# Food-Delivery frontend and backend app

## MERN app

Welcome to my app ðŸ‘‹

This is my first full stak app, I'm going to deploy it later on,
but for now I hope You could run it in a development mode.

To run app in development mode, please clone my repo https://github.com/NemesisUA/food-delivery

Or, if You prefer with SSH:

    git clone git@github.com:NemesisUA/food-delivery.git


## Run Backend:

    cd food-delivery/backend
     node server  

server is listening on port:4000.

I've added .env to repo. To provide port and database login data.

## Run Frontend:

    cd food-delivery/frontend
    npm start
